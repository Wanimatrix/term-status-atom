# term-status-atom package

**WARNING:** This package is currently in pre-alpha phase. The code is very buggy and rather unlikely to work. This is also why the package is not yet published in the Atom Package Manager.

## Purpose
The purpose of this package is to provide a terminal view inside Atom, that also displays some status symbols in the status bar (even when the terminal windows are closed).

Actually, this package is originated from a merge between the package [terminal-status](https://github.com/guileen/terminal-status.git) and [atom-term2](https://github.com/webBoxio/atom-term2.git). I therefore deeply thank the creators for their hard work!
